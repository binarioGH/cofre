# Cofre - password Manager

Do you really trust closed source programs to store all your passwords in an era when data is the new gold? 
You shouldn't.
Not only because you don't know if they have some sort of backdoor into your more sensitive information, but also because a website that stores so many passwords of so many people is the perfect target for a data leak. 

That's why I created Cofre, an offline password manager.
